# VBA-challenge
UofT-VBA-challenge

## Overview 
- In this project we are going to create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:

- 1-The ticker symbol

- 2-Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

- 3-The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

- 4-The total stock volume of the stock.

- 5-Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

- 6-Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.
